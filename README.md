# percolation_cluster_analysis
- A tool to perform percolation cluster analysis to three dimensional maps

## how to install 

- <https://github.com/louisdx/cxx-prettyprint/> and boost are used.
- cmake is used and thus you may follow the ordinary procedure
  - make a directory for example named build
  - `cd build`
  - `cmake  -DPRETTYPRINT=/path_to/cxx-prettyprint/ path_to/src && make `

- you will get an executable file, percolation_analysis_3d
